# Content decisions

Sources:
- Three résumés in `Resumes/` (not committed): **SWE.pdf**, **Quant.pdf** and **Finance.pdf**. "All three" means the fact appears in every version.
- Sean's answers to the open questions, marked **Sean** below.

## Simplified (v2) redesign

- The site is now one page (Figma "Simplified (v2)"). Copy that only exists in that Figma page was added to the data files: the headline, the three About paragraphs and the experience tag lines.
- Stop 2 of the journey is **Fairfax, Virginia (IAD)**, replacing Washington DC (**Sean**).
- Names stay as in the résumés where Figma shortens them (e.g. "Korn Ferry International", "Pairs Trading Engine with Kalman Filter").

## Positioning

- **Headline (v1, replaced by the v2 headline):** "I work where software, data and finance meet."
  - The Figma placeholder was "I design and build product interfaces." None of the résumés mention design work, so it was replaced.
  - Sean asked for a broad, non-job-specific headline.
  - The three résumés target software, quant and finance roles, and the experience spans AI engineering, investment analysis and quant projects. The headline names that common thread.
- **Availability line:** "Open to co-op and internship roles." No résumé states a target term, and Sean chose to leave it that way.
- **Contact sentence:** "co-op and internship roles in software, data and finance." This matches the three résumé targets.

## Résumé download

- `public/sean-kim-resume.pdf` is a copy of **Quant.pdf** (Sean's choice).
- It is also the broadest version: every role, all four projects, GitHub and LinkedIn, and both ML and quant skills.
- To swap it, replace the file.
- The PDF includes Sean's phone number. Sean chose to leave it as is.

## Profile facts

| Fact | Value on site | Source |
|---|---|---|
| School | University of Waterloo | All three |

| Minors | Computer Science and Economics | Quant and Finance |
| Graduation | 2029 (expected) | All three |
| Cumulative average | 90.29% | **Sean**. The résumés give a 3.94 GPA instead; the site shows only the percentage Sean supplied. |

| LinkedIn | linkedin.com/in/k-sean | All three |
| GitHub | github.com/maplekimchii | SWE and Quant (as a PDF link) |
| Languages | English, Korean, French (conversational) | Finance and Quant |
| Seven cities, four continents; city list and distances | As in the brief | **Project brief**, not the résumés. Sean chose not to show years for each city. |

## Experience

Merged into 9 entries, newest first. Home features three, chosen for variety: AXL Labs, RBC Investment Analyst and Aleph Lab. They show the current role, finance and building a company.

| Entry | Source | Conflicts and how they were resolved |
|---|---|---|
| AI Engineer, AXL Labs, Sep 2026 – Present | All three | **Organisation:** "AXL Labs" (SWE, Quant) vs "AXL" (Finance); majority used. **End date:** "Present", confirmed by **Sean**. |
| Investment Analyst, CIO Office, RBC Insurance, Jun–Aug 2026 | All three | **Title:** "CIO Office" (SWE, Quant) vs "Research and Asset Allocation" (Finance); majority used. **Organisation:** "RBC Insurance" (2) vs "RBC Insurance Investments" (1); majority used. The "12+ funds" detail comes from Finance. |
| Actuarial Analyst, CIO Office, RBC Insurance, Jan–Apr 2026 | All three | **Title:** "CIO Office" (2) vs "Investment Risk and Liability Management" (1); majority used. The bullets merge "convexity in Pandas" (SWE, Quant) and the Bloomberg API automation (SWE; Quant says BLPAPI). |
| Analyst, UW Finance Association, Sep 2025 – Present | Finance only | No result line in any résumé, so none is shown. |
| President, Waterloo/Laurier Double Degree Club, Sep 2025 – Jan 2026 | Finance; SWE lists "Double Degree Club President" under Education | No result line in any résumé. Sean is no longer in the Double Degree program, so the site doesn't claim it; the club role stays because it happened. |
| Consulting Intern, Korn Ferry International, Jun–Aug 2025 | All three | None |
| Co-Founder, Aleph Lab (YC F25, formerly Lucid AI), Mar–Jun 2025 | All three | Detail taken from SWE (Accessibility API and Gemini loop). $1M valuation in all three. |
| Fire Direction Squad Leader, 2nd Artillery Brigade, ROK Army, Sep 2023 – Mar 2025 | All three | "40%" (all three); "10+ soldiers" (Finance, Quant); commendation twice (all three) |
| Summer Analyst, Private Equity, Hanwha Life, Jun–Aug 2023 | All three | None |

**Role types:**
- Shown only where the résumé supports them:
  - "Internship": from the title "Consulting Intern"
  - "Startup": co-founder role
  - "Military service": army role
  - "Student club": the two student clubs
- Left blank for AXL, both RBC roles and Hanwha. The résumés don't say, and Sean said the information isn't needed.

**Term codes** (F26, S26, W26 …) follow Waterloo's term calendar, based on each start month: Jan–Apr = Winter, May–Aug = Summer, Sep–Dec = Fall.

## Projects

The 4 Figma projects (Korean Air Sky-Design Engine, Incheon Cargo Tracking Hub, Passport Stamp Generator System, Terminal-7 Wayfinding Interface) were placeholders. None appears in a résumé, so all four were removed.

| Code | Project | Source | Featured on Home |
|---|---|---|---|
| SK-101 | TripScape | SWE, Quant | Yes |
| SK-102 | NewsChecker | SWE, Quant | Yes |
| SK-103 | Pairs Trading Engine with Kalman Filter | Quant | Yes |
| SK-104 | Market Regime Detection & Strategy Switching | Quant | No |

- **Repo links:** the GitHub links for TripScape and NewsChecker come from the hyperlinks embedded in SWE.pdf. The quant projects have no links.
- **Case studies:** each one uses only résumé bullets, rewritten. The "problem" lines restate what the bullets describe. No new facts were added.
- **Roles** ("Full-stack build and deploy" and so on) summarise the bullets. No résumé says whether a project was solo or a team effort.
- **Year and context:** not in any résumé, so the year is hidden. Deferred to the backlog.
- **Project type:** shows the domain (Full-stack, Machine learning, Quant research), not where the project came from.

## Skills

- Groups: **Build**, **Data & ML** and **Finance**.
  - Figma's "Design" group was dropped because no résumé lists design skills.
  - The Finance group is justified by Finance.pdf (Financial Modelling, Valuations, Market Research) and the RBC roles (asset-liability management, Bloomberg API).
- Home shows 8: Python, TypeScript, React, FastAPI, SQL, PyTorch, Pandas and Financial modelling.
- Left out:
  - "Infrastructure" from Finance.pdf's skills list, because it's ambiguous on its own.
  - Win32Com and OpenPyXL, which are too narrow.

## Interests

- Six bags: Formula 1, Drumming, Golf, Defence industry, Poker and Bartending. All six appear in all three résumés; confirmed by **Sean**.
- Left out, for space: Robotics and Public Policy (SWE, Quant), and Traveling (Finance).
- No blurbs. The résumés don't say why each interest matters, and writing one would invent it.

## Thoughts

- The 4 posts in the Figma file aren't real (confirmed by **Sean**), so they were deleted.
- With no posts, the G05 nav item, the `/thoughts` routes and the Home "Latest thoughts" section are hidden.
- They reappear automatically once a post without `draft: true` is added to `src/content/posts/`.

## Privacy

- Not published on the site: phone number, street address, date of birth.
- The About page's passport card shows "Based in: Toronto, ON" instead of a date of birth.
- Nationality (Republic of Korea) is shown because Sean confirmed it.
